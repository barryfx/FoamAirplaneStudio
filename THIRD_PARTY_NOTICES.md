# FoamAirplaneStudio baseline attribution

This project derives from DesignRC and retains its license notices below.
The historical release/package descriptions refer to DesignRC; this baseline
does not include release packaging. The Windows build deploys the same Qt,
OCCT, and FreeType dependencies. No dependency sources were modified.

# DesignRC Third-Party Notices

DesignRC is Copyright (C) 2026 Barry Foust and is licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 3 only (`GPL-3.0-only`). See `LICENSE`.

DesignRC dynamically links the following separately licensed libraries. The distributed DLLs must
remain replaceable by compatible, user-modified builds. Distribution terms must not prohibit
reverse engineering when it is necessary to debug modifications to these libraries.

## Qt 6

DesignRC uses Qt Core, GUI, Widgets, OpenGL support, and platform runtime plugins. Windows releases
bundle Qt 6.11.1. The Ubuntu 24.04 package bundles Qt 6.4.2 from Ubuntu's `qt6-base` package. Qt is
Copyright (C) The Qt Company Ltd. and other contributors. The Qt components used by DesignRC are
distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (`LGPL-3.0-only`). DesignRC does
not modify Qt.

- Project: https://www.qt.io/
- Windows QtBase source: https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tag/?h=v6.11.1
- Ubuntu QtBase source package: https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/noble/qt6-base
- License: `licenses/QT-LGPL-3.0.txt`
- GNU GPL version 3 incorporated by the LGPL: `licenses/DESIGNRC-GPL-3.0.txt`

Qt contains third-party components under their own licenses. The exact components deployed with a
release are documented by Qt's generated SBOM. The build copies the QtBase and QtSvg SPDX documents
to `licenses/qt-sbom` and Qt's relevant attribution pages to `licenses/qt-attributions`.

The Windows deployment includes `opengl32sw.dll`, the Mesa llvmpipe software OpenGL renderer,
under its permissive licenses. Its complete Qt-supplied attribution is installed as
`licenses/qt-attributions/qt-attribution-llvmpipe.html`. `D3Dcompiler_47.dll`, `dxcompiler.dll`,
and `dxil.dll` are Microsoft redistributable components collected by `windeployqt` and remain under
Microsoft's applicable terms.

## Open CASCADE Technology 8.0.0

DesignRC uses Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT), Copyright (C) 1999-2026 OPEN CASCADE S.A.S. OCCT is
distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 with the Open CASCADE exception.
DesignRC does not modify OCCT.

- License: `licenses/OCCT-LGPL-2.1.txt`
- Exception: `licenses/OCCT-LGPL-EXCEPTION.txt`

## FreeType

Windows releases distribute FreeType 2.13.3 for OCCT font support. The Ubuntu package uses the
system-provided FreeType 2.13.2 shared library instead of bundling it. FreeType is Copyright (C)
1996-2024 David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, Werner Lemberg, and other contributors. The Windows
distribution uses the FreeType License (FTL), a BSD-style license with an attribution requirement.
DesignRC does not modify FreeType.

- License overview: `licenses/FREETYPE-LICENSE.txt`
- FreeType License: `licenses/FREETYPE-FTL.txt`

## International Components for Unicode 74

The Debian/Ubuntu package bundles the ICU 74 runtime libraries required by its Qt 6.4.2 build so
the package remains installable on Debian releases whose repositories provide a different ICU ABI.
ICU is Copyright (C) 1991-2022 Unicode, Inc. and other contributors and is distributed under its
permissive license. DesignRC does not modify ICU.

- Project: https://icu.unicode.org/
- Exact source package: https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/noble/icu
- License: `licenses/ICU-LICENSE.txt`

Portions of Qt and OCCT may use additional third-party components. Before publishing an installer,
compare its complete DLL and plugin inventory with the packaged Qt and OCCT SBOM/license data and
add any required notices. Microsoft runtime components, when included, are redistributed under
Microsoft's applicable terms and are not covered by DesignRC's GPL license.


## FoamAirplaneStudio Qt PDF addition

Reference PDF rendering uses Qt PDF 6.11.1 (QtPdf), dynamically linked under the
same Qt LGPL-3.0 terms above. Qt PDF embeds PDFium and associated third-party
components. The add-on's SPDX bill of materials is copied to licenses/qt-sbom.
